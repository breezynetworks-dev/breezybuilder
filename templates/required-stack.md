# Required Stack

These are your universal preferences that apply to ALL projects.
BreezyBuilder will use these as the foundation for every build.

Edit this file to match your personal/team tech preferences.

## Notes

- These choices are NON-NEGOTIABLE during planning
- Experts build within these constraints, they don't debate them
- Project-specific tools (auth, payments, etc.) are selected during intake
- Edit this file BEFORE running /breezybuilder:plan if you want different choices

## What Belongs Here vs. Toolbox

**Required Stack (this file):**
- Framework choices you ALWAYS want
- Styling systems you prefer
- Deployment target

**Potential Toolbox:**
- Options for auth (Clerk, NextAuth, etc.)
- Options for payments (Stripe, etc.)
- Options for email (Resend, etc.)
- Options for database hosting
- Tools you might use depending on project needs

The intake phase will select from your toolbox based on project requirements.
